# Frontend Requirements

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.8.

### Dependencies

| Rank | Library versions                  | Mine     |
| ---: | --------------------------------- | -------- |
|    1 | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) | v18.19.0 |
|    2 | [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)     | 10.2.5   |

Check [Angular version](https://angular.dev/reference/versions)

## Development server

Don't forget to run `npm install` first. Check if the node_modules folder exists ;)

Run `ng serve` or `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Code Security

Already installed a pipeline of out-format, and check for code security standards: [TsLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint)
It also fires, when you try to push the code, so there might be errors. So I ADVICE to pre-check, before pushing.
`npm run validate`

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
You might have to run `npm install -g karma-cli` first if not working. Not the best, but they will be there to help, and I hope more know-how will enter the project.

## Build <= not needed for dev

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests -> not planned

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
